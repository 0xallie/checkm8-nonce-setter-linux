# checkm8-nonce-setter
A nonce setter for all devices compatible with checkm8

-----------------------------------------

iOS version doesn't matter. If your device is compatible with checkm8 then you can set your nonce and downgrade.

-----------------------------------------

You need git installed for this to work. There shouldn't be any other dependencies

-----------------------------------------

After setting nonce with this, you can futurerestore with the shsh you used during the script. 

-----------------------------------------

Keep in mind SEP and Baseband both need to be compatible with the version you are trying to downgrade to. This script doesn't change that, only allows you to set your nonce without being jailbroken.

-----------------------------------------

Also if you were a tester you should use this latest version as it fixes some issues.
